# 🧠 Quantum Learning

**Quantum Learning** is a personal and open-source project inspired by Duolingo, aiming to develop a **gamified and interactive** web platform for language learning and, in the future, **quantum computing**. The central idea is to make learning more inclusive, fun, and accessible for everyone.

---

## 🎯 Overview

The project has two main phases:

1. **Current Phase:** Clone the main features of Duolingo for teaching English and Portuguese.
2. **Future Phase:** Adapt the platform for introductory quantum computing education, with interactive learning paths on the following topics:
   - Basic linear algebra
   - Fundamentals of classical computing
   - Introduction to quantum computing

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Create an engaging and motivating learning experience based on micro-lessons and rewards.
- Offer a free, open-source system accessible via web browser.
- Democratize access to quantum computing knowledge, especially in under-resourced regions.

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Next.js** 15
- **React** 19
- **TypeScript**
- **TailwindCSS**
- **Radix UI**
- **Lucide React**
- **Class Variance Authority**
- **clsx**
- **tw-animate-css**

> Backend, authentication, donation system, and database integration are still under development.
